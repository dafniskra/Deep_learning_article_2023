# Neural Network and Ensemble Learning
This repository contains code related to the article titled "Neural Network and Ensemble Learning with Application to Accident Frequencies." The code includes implementations in both R and Python.

In collaboration with Fabien Navarro (Website: fnavarro.perso.math.cnrs.fr), this work aims to understand the contributions of ensemble methods with deep learning in predicting accident frequencies.

## Models from the Literature:
NNemb
CANN
For the tree and boosting models, the code is sourced from the article titled "Nesting Classical Actuarial Models into Neural Networks" by Schelldorfer, JÃ¼rg, and Mario V. Wuthrich (2019). The article is available here (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3320525).

# Code
In this section, we provide details on the code and data used for the experiments.

## Data Source
We utilized the FreMTPL2freq dataset for this project.

## Data Preparation
To ensure robust results, we employed a Monte Carlo cross-validation approach by creating 10 different datasets. Each dataset was divided into 85% for training and 15% for testing. This method enhances the reliability of our results.

## R Code
Regression CANN
Regression NNEmb

## Python Code
Bagging
NN with Dropout
NN with Tanh and Sigmoid activation functions
